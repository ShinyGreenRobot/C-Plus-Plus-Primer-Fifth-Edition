- Exercise 1.7 Notes -
----------------------

The following code fragment has incorrectly nested comments:

/* Deactivate print
/* Print hello world*/
std::cout << "Hello, World" << std::endl;
*/
return 0;

This will not compile, the exact error statements depends on the rest of the
code base. The following error was presented when trying to compile a program
included the above code fragment:

Description                                     Type
expected primary-expression before ‘return’     /C++ Problem

Note that the compiler, in this case GCC, also issued a warning that identifies
the problem:

Description               Type
"/*" within comment       C/C++ Problem
