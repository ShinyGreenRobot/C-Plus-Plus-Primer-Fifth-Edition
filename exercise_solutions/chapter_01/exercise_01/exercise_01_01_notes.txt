- Exercise 1.1 Notes -
----------------------

Objective of this exercise is to get basic understanding on how to compile a 
simple program. The source code for the program can be found in the folder that 
this document is located in.

The program was compiled with GCC version 7.2.0 on a computer running Ubuntu 
Linux.

The following command was used to compile the code in a terminal window:

$ g++ exercise_01_01_main.cpp

This produced a file called a.out that is a executable file. The program was 
then run by typing the following command:

$ ./a.out

The program does not really do anything so there was no output or other action
when the program was executed.

The return code of the program (0) was printed when the following command was 
run after running the program:

$ echo $?
