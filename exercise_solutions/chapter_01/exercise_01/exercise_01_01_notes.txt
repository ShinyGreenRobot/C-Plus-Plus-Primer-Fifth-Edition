----------------

Objective of this exercise is to get basic understanding on how to compile a simple program. The source code for the program can be found in the folder that this document is located in.

The program was compiled with GCC version 7.2.0 on a computer running Ubuntu Linux.

The following command was used to compile the code in a terminal window.

$ g++ exercise_01_01_main.cpp

This produced a file called a.out that is a executable file. The program was run by typing.

./a.out

The program does not really do anything so there was no output or other action.

A the return code (0) was printed when the following command was run after running the program.

$ echo $?
