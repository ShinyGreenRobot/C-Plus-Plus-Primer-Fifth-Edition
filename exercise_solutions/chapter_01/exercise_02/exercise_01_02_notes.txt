- Exercise 1.2 Notes -
----------------------

Objective of this exercise is to see how the environment handles failure 
indicators returned from C++ programs. The source code for the test program can
be found in the same folder that this document is located in. Note that the 
program returns 1.

The program was compiled with GCC version 7.2.0 on a computer running Ubuntu 
Linux. The program does not really do anything so there was no output or other 
action when the program was executed. The failure indicator did not caunse
anything special to happen.

The return code of the program (1) was printed in the terminal when the 
following command was excuted after running the program:

$ echo $?
