It is a common error to forget the semicolon after a class or struct definiton. The following program suffers from this error.

struct Foo {
    // empty on purpose
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
}

This code causes the following error when compiling with GCC version 5.4.0 so.

expected ‘;’ after struct definition
